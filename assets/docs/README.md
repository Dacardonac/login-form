## Login Page - Frontend Practice 👨‍💻

This project is a **Login Page** developed as part of a challenge to practice **HTML5**, **CSS3 (Sass)** and **JavaScript** skills. The project was created using **Vite** as a bundler, with a modularized style structure in **Sass** and applying the **BEM (Block Element Modifier)** methodology for better organization and maintenance of the CSS code with classes .

## Technologies and Tools Used 💻

- **Vite**: Used for quick project setup and performance optimization.
- **HTML5**: Semantic structure of the page.
- **Sass (SCSS)**: CSS preprocessor used to modularize and optimize styles.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Basic logic for the functionality of buttons and popups.
- **BEM**: Naming methodology to organize CSS and keep code scalable.
- **Ionicons**: Used as interactive icons.

## Setup 🔧

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dacardonac/login-form.git
```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
```bash
cd login-form
```
3. Install the dependencies with npm:

4. Start the development server:

```

## Functionality ✅

- Login and Register Form: The forms have smooth transitions and are fully responsive.
